									<p> Work tells you how to live, art tells you why. "The flow of art, is meditation"; as Prasad says it. The canvas comes alive and sees right through you. It doesn't matter when, how, what and why; it is now, this moment here. The canvas becomes the only sense of reality. How you think of yourself and this world, the way you understand others, to love and have someone break through your walls gracefully, to actually believe in life, is art.</p> 
									<p> The paint bleeds and ink runs.  </p>

												<h3>The Sketchbook</h3>
											</header>
											<p> Prasad gifted it to me in 2018. After almost a year, it has become a part of me now. I made simple sketches throughout the year (and few tough ones :)). Although I have realised how it has helped me become a better person.
											From sketches to painting, and then to writing; it was indeed a freedom within the confined space that it offered. As the painting comes alive, you get to know what you've been feeling all this while. It calms the storm inside your heart. On the canvas, the storm paints itself. 
											</p>
											<p>The Sketchbook is precious, and should be protected from the world. So I gave it to my zombie apocalypse survival partner. (She sometimes turns into a zombie though). </p>
