									<p>I’m particularly interested in flying, and everything that Aeromodelling relates itself to. I believe I’m just on the surface of technology, knowledge and understanding should go together. There’s much more to learn; and it is important to understand why it is that way. I’m the kind of person who learns a lot through interaction: asking questions and most importantly- focussing on the practical aspect. I’ve always wanted to build things, I’m an artist myself, and even though I appreciate the aesthetics of the planes and drones we fly, I’m more interested in anticipating what’s within them. </p>

												<h3>My current project</h3>

											<p>I am currently working on building a clone of DJI Mavic Pro. All the parts have been 3D printed and assembled.
											All that's left is giving life to it with the electronics. This is one of the projects that gives sanity to the last four years of my craziness for quadcopters.  </p>
